# Identifying-High-Quality-Leads
This project builds an AI-powered lead scoring system for BrewMasters Coffee Catering. Website form data flows into n8n, where an LLM scores each lead. High-value leads trigger instant Gmail alerts, while others route to manual review. All leads log in Google Sheets for organized tracking and faster response times.
